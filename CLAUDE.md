# SoloPianoTranscription

Pipeline for transcribing solo piano performances from YouTube into editable sheet music: YouTube link → 44.1 kHz WAV (yt-dlp + `scripts/prepare_audio.sh`) → MIDI (Transkun v2) → MusicXML (`transcription_cleanup.py quantize`) → .mscz (MuseScore 4 CLI, format conversion only). Used for pieces where no published sheet music exists.

## Environment

- Always use the project venv binaries — never global installs:
  - `.venv/bin/python`
  - `.venv/bin/yt-dlp`
  - `.venv/bin/transkun`
- MuseScore CLI path (constant): `/Applications/MuseScore 4.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore`
- ffmpeg is at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` (needed by yt-dlp).
- If `.venv` doesn't exist: `python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install transkun yt-dlp music21 'llvmlite==0.42.0' 'numba==0.59.1' librosa` (pulls PyTorch, ~2 GB; llvmlite/numba are pinned because newer releases ship no x86_64 macOS wheels).
- `scripts/transcription_cleanup.py` (run with `.venv/bin/python`) provides `analyze` / `clean` / `beats` / `quantize` / `post` / `verify` / `consensus` subcommands used by the pipeline and `cleanup-score` skills.
- `scripts/prepare_audio.sh <in> <out.wav>` — two-pass linear loudness normalization + 44.1 kHz resample; run on all audio before Transkun.

## Output layout

One directory per piece, named by the slugified video title:

```
output/<slug>/
├── <slug>.wav        # prepared audio (44.1 kHz, loudness-normalized) — transcription input
├── <slug>.mp3        # listening copy
├── <slug>.mid        # Transkun transcription (performance timing, unquantized)
├── <slug>.musicxml   # quantized score (interchange format)
├── <slug>.mscz       # native MuseScore 4 file (for direct editing)
├── <slug>.pdf        # printable score (from .mscz) — also the visual-inspection artifact
├── <slug>.cleaned.*  # cleanup-score products (mid/musicxml/mscz/pdf) — originals stay untouched
├── beats.json        # audio beat-tracking (librosa) — drives rubato-aware quantization
├── clean_report.json # machine summary of the MIDI clean pass
├── verify.json       # per-bar score-vs-recording similarity (chroma DTW)
└── CLEANUP_NOTES.md  # what was changed + what to verify by ear
```

## Pipeline stage commands

```bash
# 1. Download audio (slug comes from --restrict-filenames); decode once to WAV,
#    normalize linearly, derive a listening mp3 — never feed a re-encoded mp3 to Transkun
.venv/bin/yt-dlp -x --audio-format wav --restrict-filenames \
  -o 'output/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s' '<url>'
scripts/prepare_audio.sh 'output/<slug>/<slug>.wav' 'output/<slug>/<slug>.prepared.wav'
mv 'output/<slug>/<slug>.prepared.wav' 'output/<slug>/<slug>.wav'
/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg -i 'output/<slug>/<slug>.wav' -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 \
  'output/<slug>/<slug>.mp3'

# 2. Audio → MIDI
.venv/bin/transkun 'output/<slug>/<slug>.wav' 'output/<slug>/<slug>.mid' --device cpu

# 3. MIDI → MusicXML (script quantizer — NEVER MuseScore's MIDI import),
#    then the pedal pass (the score must reflect the MIDI's actual CC64
#    pedaling), then .mscz via mscore (format conversion only).
#    BPM from the user / web ground truth, else an analyze candidate;
#    verify via score_seconds_at_bpm ≈ audio_seconds in the summary.
.venv/bin/python scripts/transcription_cleanup.py quantize \

```

## Skills

- `transcribe` — full pipeline from a YouTube URL; use for "transcribe this video" requests
- `download-audio` — stage 1 only
- `audio-to-midi` — stage 2 only (also works on local audio files the user provides)
- `midi-to-musicxml` — stage 3 only (exports both .musicxml and .mscz)
- `cleanup-score` — post-pipeline cleanup: web ground-truth lookup (key/meter), artifact removal, notation repair, velocity-derived dynamics/hairpins, `CLEANUP_NOTES.md` with verify-by-ear flags. Changes only what's decidable from data; never overwrites originals. Supports MIDI-only mode (steps 1–3, `.cleaned.mid` + notes, no MusicXML/.mscz) when the user wants just a cleaned MIDI.

## Notation sanity (reason about the score, don't just convert)

- **Articulation question (rule)**: before starting transcription of a new piece, explicitly ask the user whether to diverge from the legato default. Legato default = note durations fill to the next onset (`quantize` does this automatically). If the user opts out, pass `quantize --no-legato-fill` and use the MIDI's performed durations to decide musically where staccato/other articulation marks belong (short raw durations against long gaps = detached playing). Either way `quantize` is pedal-aware: fill never bridges a same-staff silence longer than ~a beat (under pedal the note holds to the beat boundary; pedal-up it keeps the performed length), and pedal-carried rings never become sustained second voices — Transkun durations under pedal are acoustic smear, and engraving them makes drones, voice stacks, and padding-rest spray.
- **Balanced measures (rule)**: every measure and every voice must sum exactly to the bar duration — notes plus explicit rests, never invisible gaps. `quantize` and `post` print a `lint` block (unbalanced-measure count + printed-accidental ratio) with every generated score; a verdict other than "ok" must be fixed before delivering.
- **Visual inspection (rule)**: every final `.mscz` gets a PDF (`"$MSCORE" <file>.mscz -o <file>.pdf`), and the PDF must be inspected visually (Read the PDF pages directly) before delivery. Look for what the lint cannot see: marks floating mid-system or doubled, pedal lines not under the bass staff, colliding elements, multi-voice clutter / padding-rest spray, drone durations that halt the texture, fragmented beaming. Fix what is decidable and re-export; flag the rest.

After producing any score, inspect it for statistical outliers — transcription and quantization errors look like values that don't belong in the piece's rhythm profile:

- Build a note-type histogram (`grep -o "<type>[a-z0-9]*</type>" <file>.musicxml | sort | uniq -c`). A handful of 32nds/64ths/128ths in a piece that is overwhelmingly 16ths-and-eighths are almost certainly artifacts (onset jitter, ghost notes, split sustains), not music — find them, and either fix what's clearly decidable (e.g. merge a 32nd+rest pair that sums to the prevailing 16th) or flag them for by-ear review.
- The same applies to rests: isolated tiny rests punched into an otherwise continuous 16th-note texture are quantization gaps (duration snapped down past the next onset), not phrasing.
- Judge outliers in context: a 32nd-note run in one contiguous passage is likely a real ornament/flourish; the same values scattered randomly one-at-a-time through the piece are noise.
- A tuplet explosion, or a histogram dominated by values one "level" off from what the piece sounds like, means the BPM/grid was wrong — requantize rather than patching notes.
- After cleanup, run `verify` (renders the score, DTW-aligns chroma against the recording): its `worst_bars`, `drift_suspects`, and `repeat_inconsistencies` are the listening priorities for CLEANUP_NOTES. Chroma is octave-blind — a guide, not proof.

## Docs

- **Keep README.md and CLAUDE.md in sync with reality and each other.** Whenever a change makes either outdated (pipeline stages, commands, file layout, dependencies, skills), update both in the same delivery — README.md for humans (overview, setup, usage), CLAUDE.md for the agent (commands, paths, gotchas). Never describe the old pipeline in one file and the new one in the other.

## Git

- Commit automatically after every delivered change (new/updated skills, scripts, docs, pipeline fixes) — one commit per delivery with a descriptive message. Don't wait to be asked.
- `output/` and `.venv/` are gitignored; only project sources are versioned.
- When a previously working stage regresses, use `git bisect` with a script that runs the failing conversion (e.g. mscore exit code on a kept test artifact) to find the breaking commit.

## Gotchas

- Transkun expects 44.1 kHz input; `scripts/prepare_audio.sh` guarantees it (and applies linear loudness normalization — never dynamic-mode loudnorm, which compresses dynamics and skews velocities). Run it on all audio before Transkun, including user-supplied files.
- Stage 2 takes a few minutes per piece on CPU — run it in the background and don't assume it hung.
- Stages are re-run safe by convention: before running a stage, check whether its output file already exists and is non-empty, and skip it unless the user asked to redo it.
- `mscore` may print Qt warnings to stderr even on success — judge by exit code and whether the output file was written.
- Quote all paths: video-title slugs can still contain characters that need quoting, and the mscore path contains a space.
- **Never import a `.mid` into MuseScore** (CLI or GUI) — its quantization auto-detects its own tempo, ignores the tempo and time-signature meta events, and can lock onto a sub-pulse (e.g. the dotted-eighth of a 3-3-2 groove → 4/3 of the true BPM), wronging every barline and spraying fake tuplets. All MIDI → MusicXML goes through `transcription_cleanup.py quantize --bpm <bpm>`; mscore is only for `.musicxml` → `.mscz`/PDF format conversion.
- The quantize grid stands or falls with the BPM. Prefer the user / web ground truth over statistical candidates, and check the quantize summary: `score_seconds_at_bpm` must be within a few percent of `audio_seconds`.
- Grid choice: steady performance → fixed `--bpm` grid (cleaner notation); rubato → `beats` subcommand + `quantize --beats` (barlines follow the performance). Always seed `beats --bpm-hint` with ground truth — audio beat trackers lock onto sub-pulses just like autocorrelation (this is also why `quantize` infers the downbeat phase and may open bar 1 with pickup rests — when the inference confidence is marginal and the evidence disagrees, override with `quantize --bar-phase 0`).
- For heavy rubato / deep ritardandi, prefer `beats --from-midi <cleaned.mid> --midi-shift <trim_shift_s>`: it DP-tracks the transcription's own onsets. The audio tracker pinned to a hint cannot follow a deep slowdown — it falls behind, then races ahead at a fake fast tempo and mangles every barline after it. Sanity metric: the fraction of MIDI onsets within 0.07 beat of a 16th slot of the grid should be ≳0.95.
- For near-steady grooves with strong syncopation (e.g. 3-3-2), *both* trackers chase the accent layer — the audio tracker's beats land off the true quarters, and the onset DP's period histogram smears between the quarter and the dotted eighth. Use `beats --refine <mid> --bpm-hint <bpm> --midi-shift <trim_shift_s>`: fixed grid scanned around the hint, then smoothly refined to the MIDI onsets (metrical level locked by construction; follows drift, not syncopation). Its report carries `onset_grid_fit` — on jittery human grooves ~0.7 with onset peaks centered on the 16th slots is healthy; compare candidate grids by this number (an audio-tracked grid scoring ~0.25 means most notes snap to wrong slots: shifted melody, false dotted rhythms).
- Pieces with several tempi/keys are supported: `quantize --beats` engraves a metronome-mark change per sustained tempo plateau (>12% for 16+ beats; more than 4 levels = rubato, single median mark), `post` engraves real key-signature changes for persistent modulations (and restores the global key), and `clean --tempo-map beats.json` writes a beat-aligned MIDI tempo map so DAW bar grids follow the performance.
- **Score metadata rule**: every generated `.musicxml`/`.mscz` must carry the piece metadata in its header via `quantize --title/--composer/--arranger/--performer` — title and original composer/artist always; arranger when it's an arrangement/cover with a known author; performer when the pianist is known. Only include roles that make sense for the piece.
- music21 `makeMeasures()` does not split notes at barlines — always follow with `makeTies()`, or MuseScore rejects the overfull measures (exit 40).
- music21 `makeMeasures()` attaches `Accidental('natural')` objects to notes; if they're not stripped before computing accidental display (`normalize_accidentals` in the cleanup script), the export prints an accidental on literally every note.
- zsh does not word-split unquoted variables; don't stash multi-word commands in shell variables.
